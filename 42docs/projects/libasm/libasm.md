Assembly is a more visual way of coding direct processor instructions. It should
therefore be noted that it is very important to read proper documentation on
this topic, as there are a variety of instructions available.

## Learning ASM

One of the best books available to learn assembly is [The Art of Assembly Language](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~pannain/mc404/aulas/pdfs/Art%20Of%20Intel%20x86%20Assembly.pdf)
as it explains very well what is happening within the procedures you call. If
you want to learn Assembly properly, you *must* read the book accordingly. Do
take notes as it will help you recap some concepts.

Sidenote: if you are just going to move things around till it works, ask
yourself WHY it works. This is very important as it will help you become a
better programmer in ANY programming language!

## Extra sources

Then there are a number of other sources you can use to lookup how certain
instructions work and what the procedures are within the processors. I used the
following references for this:

- [Getting started](https://riptutorial.com/assembly)
- [Calling conventions](https://www.raywenderlich.com/615-assembly-register-calling-convention-tutorial)
- [Interfacing](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Interfacing_with_Linux)
- [Optimizing Subroutines](https://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf)
- [Intel Documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf)
- [Intel Documentation Summary](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/index.html)
- [Intel Pentium Documentation](http://faydoc.tripod.com/cpu/index.htm)
- [How to use SSE2 for strcmp, strlen and strstr](https://www.strchr.com/strcmp_and_strlen_using_sse_4.2)

Good luck on your assembly project!
