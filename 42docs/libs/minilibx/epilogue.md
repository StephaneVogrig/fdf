Now that you have finally completed the entire tutorial, you can finally say
that you are a true master on MiniLibX. We have also created documentation for
each function in case you quickly need to look it up or forgot what the
according prototype was [over here](./prototypes.html).

If you think something is missing from this tutorial, feel free to hit us up
with a pull request and we will check it ASAP.

Good luck with your projects!
